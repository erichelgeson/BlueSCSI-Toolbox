## What is it?

BlueSCSI Toolbox is a set of 68k apps for Macintosh. The BlueSCSI Transfer Utility is the first app in a suite.

It's solving an all too common problem - how do you get files from the Macintosh Garden or anywhere to your vintage mac. Not everyone has a bridge machine, a network card, the ability to write disks, or the know how to get an emulator setup - they just want their mac to work! We want to make the process of getting Oregon Trail onto your Mac Plus, or Open Transport to your Quadra as easy as drag and drop.

As the name suggests the BlueSCSI SD Transfer Utility allows you to place those files you download on your modern computer directly on the SD card in a shared directory. Once you boot up the vintage computer you can then Download files from the SD card to your Mac. We'll even try to fix the file type and creator for you.

You can also upload files from your vintage mac to your SD card to backup those Claris documents or Quicktake images from the 90's.
